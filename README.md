Valuation of a FTSE 250 company in the cyber industry 


This report investigates and gives an in-depth explanation of the valuation of NCC Group plc. In doing so, this valuation highlights the group's historical performance while analysing management efficiency and explaining the source of the group's core sustainable competitive advantage and revenue growth projection. Major assumptions used in this valuation take the school of thought of reputable scholars such as Aswath Damodaran, CFA, Kemi Akinde, CFA, and McKinsey in revenue, financial statement forecasting, and cost of capital calculation. Furthermore, certain concepts of valuation might not produce tantamount results as the financials of the company were integrated and adjusted over time to adhere with the FIRS standard of reporting. Finally, assumptions made in this valuation are based on publicly available information about the company and the stock market at large.![image](https://github.com/jebepelumi/Company-Valuation/assets/87954528/f5ac601d-8438-4f29-a861-a5c535881e6b)
